%  Stephane,
%  
%  thanks for translating your message to english; my french learned in
%  school
%  unfortunately hasn't survived the last 20 years, but due to the sample i
%  was
%  already able to identify the problem from your original mail (but didn't
%  manage to reply in time to save you the trouble)
%  
%  you are right, your problem is due to a change in varioref, but I
%  consider
%  myself blameless :-) the real culprit seems to be the following line in
%  fancyref:
%  
%\newcommand*{\@fancyref@page@ref}{\@ifnextchar[%]
%  \@vpageref{\@vpageref[\unskip]}%
%}%
%  
%  the above calls an internal command of varioref, and not an official
%  interface, so this should be addressed to Axel (hope his email is
%  still correct).
%  
%  as a workaround add the following after loading fancyref:
%  
\makeatletter
\renewcommand*{\@fancyref@page@ref}{%
  \let\vref@space\space
  \@ifnextchar[%]
  \@vpageref{\@vpageref[\unskip]}%
}%
\makeatother
%  
%  hope this helps
%  frank
